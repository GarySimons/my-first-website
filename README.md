# My very first web page

Welcome!

This was the very first web project in my Full Stack Development course.

It brings together all the lessons we've been through so far: HTML, JavaScript, Cloud9, Git and GitHub

It has taught me just how all of the pieces of the puzzle fit together to create a whole. 

This is given me a clear understanding of the basics of creating a website.
